# If set, the following env variables override image registry and/or tag for each of the images.
# They are named after the image name, with hyphen replaced by underscore and in upper case.
#
# - CSI_NODE_DRIVER_REGISTRAR_REGISTRY
# - CSI_NODE_DRIVER_REGISTRAR_TAG
# - HOSTPATHPLUGIN_REGISTRY
# - HOSTPATHPLUGIN_TAG
#
# Alternatively, it is possible to override all registries or tags with:
# - IMAGE_REGISTRY
# - IMAGE_TAG
# These are used as fallback when the more specific variables are unset or empty.
#
# IMAGE_TAG=canary is ignored for images that are blacklisted in the
# deployment's optional canary-blacklist.txt file. This is meant for
# images which have known API breakages and thus cannot work in those
# deployments anymore. That text file must have the name of the blacklisted
# image on a line by itself, other lines are ignored. Example:
#
# Beware that the .yaml files do not have "imagePullPolicy: Always". That means that
# also the "canary" images will only be pulled once. This is good for testing
# (starting a pod multiple times will always run with the same canary image), but
# implies that refreshing that image has to be done manually.
#
# As a special case, 'none' as registry removes the registry name.

# Some images are not affected by *_REGISTRY/*_TAG and IMAGE_* variables.
# The default is to update unless explicitly excluded.
